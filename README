VISUALDREAMS

The VisualDreams engine consists of years of programming experience by Gunther Voet.
Some of this code will be gradually released towards the outside world. Most of this
code still needs to be made modular before it can be used by the general public.

The engine is specifically written towards rapid processing of rich-media files,
xml in-output and realtime conversion, rpc-xml and server routines. This to ensure
compatibility towards different platforms and devices.
